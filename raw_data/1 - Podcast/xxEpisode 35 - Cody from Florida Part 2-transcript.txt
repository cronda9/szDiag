Hello, and welcome to another episode interview or for schizophrenia. And I'm your host Samara singer. And today I have to pray a pleasure to help you. Cody with me, Cody is from Florida and he has a multitude of disorders, including did PTSD, schizophrenia, and depression. This is actually his second time. He's on the show. He first appeared on episode 26 in February, 2021. So welcome to the show again, Cody, how you doing today?

2 (1m 7s):
I'm doing okay.

1 (1m 10s):
That's good stuff.

2 (1m 11s):
It's been a readjustment since I got back from New York.

1 (1m 15s):
And so why don't you tell us about what's recently going on with you?

2 (1m 22s):
I had a little bit of trouble controlling my psychosis two months ago, so it kind of took me on a trip to New York just so I could find myself in, get help for that. Now I'm on good medication and I'm getting back into a routine, including finding gainful employment.

1 (1m 51s):
Yeah. So when you're talking about psychosis, what exactly was happening that caused you to have a crisis?

2 (2m 2s):
Well, I stopped taking my medication. I was off work for a little bit. My mom passed away the day before my birthday, so I had a lot of stuff going on. Yeah.

1 (2m 21s):
Yeah. I think, you know, if you stop your medication for, say, for say a week more than a week or more, then things will go pretty bad pretty quickly. Maybe even, maybe even a few days, fingers will start to go pretty bad pretty quickly.

2 (2m 42s):
I've learned that when you quickly.

1 (2m 44s):
Yeah, because if you're like me, I think we still experience psychosis even on medication. So you tied that medication away and it's, you're in a world of hurt. It's like a complete mind map. Yeah. And, and also you've got to deal with the withdrawal symptoms of the meds as well, which

2 (3m 9s):
I've learned that one.

1 (3m 11s):
Yeah. Physically painful as your body adjusts to live in without a medication that can be painful. So in New York, what was that? Was that a hospital or what happened to,

2 (3m 25s):
Yeah, I went to a hospital, quite a few of them.

1 (3m 31s):
Okay. Was that, did you have on your medical insurance?

2 (3m 36s):
Yeah, my, they gave me good insurance. They gave me Medicaid actually, which covered for everything.

1 (3m 47s):
Okay. So what was that experience like? Was it, what was the hospital like? Did you meet other people there with, with severe mental health problems?

2 (3m 58s):
Yeah. I, I, I met a person with severe depression who was kind of undergoing this new treatment for treating depression. It's where they kind of put you in a seizure-like state and you're asleep at the same time and it creates brainwaves to counteract the whole depression thing.

1 (4m 28s):
Mm, wow. That sounds pretty high tech. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's kind of strange the way these medical scientists come up with cures for mental illness and that always like kind of physical cures by even the medication is affects us physically. You know, we can go back with electric shock treatments and lobotomies and that all physical actions on the body, you know, rather than, you know, it's a mental illness. Maybe they should think about joining something non non-invasive, you know, because it's, it's a mental, it's not physical.

1 (5m 19s):
Sorry. So you, how long did you spend in New York where you, how long were you there for? Cause I was trying to get hold of you and I couldn't get ahold of you.

2 (5m 28s):
I was there for a period of two months all together.

1 (5m 32s):
Yeah. Yeah. Because I was trying to get in touch with you. Oh yeah. So I mean,

2 (5m 43s):
I, I didn't really have access to my phone because the service went offline. So I had to utilize wifi spots around the city.

1 (5m 57s):
So how do you keeping now? What, how has your state now?

2 (6m 4s):
Pretty good actually, right. Doing, yeah. Were keeping it together on track. Oops. I think we introduced our guests a little too early.

1 (6m 21s):
I think your threat, your altar. I remember the code talking about you.

2 (6m 30s):
Yeah.

1 (6m 33s):
Dylan, how, how are you feeling?

2 (6m 37s):
Good. I've kept a eye on Cody over the length of the two months we were gone.

1 (6m 48s):
You quite a dominant personality.

2 (6m 53s):
Okay.

1 (6m 54s):
I'm asking, are you dominant or

2 (6m 60s):
Yeah, I'm kind of dumb, dumb knit and the older brother protective type.

1 (7m 7s):
Yeah. So was Cody Cody want to hide away just now? Is that what Dylan came out?

2 (7m 18s):
No, we, we can coincide that's right. We're both in it together.

1 (7m 28s):
Yeah. Okay. I've Dylan. So tell me, do you have any mental conditions, mental health conditions?

2 (7m 40s):
No.

1 (7m 42s):
So your kind of like normal Yorta, Yorta, brave face of Cody, right?

2 (7m 50s):
Right. I am.

1 (7m 52s):
Hmm. That's interesting. Yeah. You know, so sometimes I think I have alter egos, but I'm not, I haven't got a diagnosis of the ID, but sometimes I think I have, I think, I think some folks didn't have all two egos, but with the IB, I guess it's kind of deeper this a deep, deep issues, I suppose.

2 (8m 24s):
All right.

1 (8m 28s):
So Dylan, tell me, do you know about the other personalities in Cody?

2 (8m 41s):
Yeah. I know some.

1 (8m 43s):
How do you feel about them?

2 (8m 47s):
Well, I kind of assess the situation with all of them and I sometimes get a chance to work with some of them one-on-one, but as for the ones we don't really, like, we kind of keep our distance from them.

1 (9m 13s):
How, what, what do you, how do you feel about being a dissociated identity from Cody? Do you want more or do you want less or how do you feel unstable?

2 (9m 29s):
Yeah, I'm stable. I don't mind being in altar just as much as I look out for him and protect him like a big brother. What that's, that's basically my job. That's all, I'm basically here for kind of pushing him in the right common sense direction sometimes.

1 (9m 52s):
Yeah. How old are you?

2 (10m 1s):
35.

1 (10m 3s):
35. Okay. Okay. Is Cody going to come back or is he doesn't want to come out?

2 (10m 15s):
I'm right here.

1 (10m 17s):
Okay. Cody.

2 (10m 23s):
Yeah.

1 (10m 23s):
I want to speak to you more about deep psychosis. I mean, to be honest, you sound, you sound as if I think you have been through a lot recently. So I guess, I guess, let me, let me get this clear. I, I just want you to talk about what you can talk about now when you can't talk about, usually I, I do, I do suspect that when you are two months in New York, you probably could talk about your mental health issues, which may have satisfied you, do you think that's true?

2 (11m 13s):
Yeah.

1 (11m 16s):
Yeah. And now, now, perhaps you just want to get on with things in life maybe.

2 (11m 22s):
Yeah. I mean, now I'm in the process of getting ready to go to college, start a new job. I mean, now I'm on the proper meds. So plus I had an appointment with a doctor next month. So

1 (11m 48s):
How are you? Day-to-day are you coping day-to-day? I mean, how does your, how has your life affected from your mental health conditions?

2 (12m 3s):
It really depends on the day because I still get hit with a depressive episodes sometimes where it wants to slow me down, wants me to kind of cope with it, kind of sit in it, not really take care of myself, like personal hygiene, whatnot, but then I do take the meds and eventually I'm able to push those thoughts aside and jump in the shower, feel better and joined my family.

1 (12m 55s):
I suppose, I, in my, in my point of view, I try to just, you think it was when I was 26? I was that's that's that's like 20 years ago for me, you know, I guess was 27 now. So that was 20 years ago for me. And it was pretty all war. I didn't really have a good insight into mental illness. I was pretty delusional back then. I had all these strange ideas. So science fiction, fantasy ideas of reality.

1 (13m 36s):
Do you know what I mean? I don't know if you, if you can relate if you have delusions.

2 (13m 41s):
Yeah. I mean, I'm a big believer in the whole, most diverse thing.

1 (13m 46s):
Yeah. But that's, that's kind of like a standard idea. I mean, is your delusion take it further? Does it take it into a more terrifying side of it?

2 (14m 0s):
I, I get interesting alters coming from the multi-verse all the time.

3 (14m 9s):
Okay.

1 (14m 13s):
So how do you feel about that?

2 (14m 18s):
And it's, it's kind of like going on an exploration expedition, like you get to play scientist a tad.

1 (14m 35s):
Okay. That's good. Yeah. So what I'm saying is like, when I was 27, I had a lack of insight into mental health. I was having severe delusions. And to be honest with you, I was struggling with employment. Well, if, if I had a job, it would only last a max of about 18 months before I could, before I got another one, just because it was just difficult for me just to settle down. I just kept losing move on.

1 (15m 17s):
Yeah, it is. I think it's difficult working. I mean, working with these conditions, it's quite difficult because like the meds, the meds would make me very drowsy during the day. I I'd sit on my computer and it was like torture because I'll be feeling as if I want to fall asleep and I had to keep going to the bathroom, put water on my face. Yeah. That, that was kind of a torture. I don't know if you have similar stories of like struggling in the workplace with being heavily medicated.

1 (16m 8s):
I mean, is that something that you were late to Cody? Are you, are you upset about something

2 (16m 24s):
Now? It's just, I was kind of checking my phone. I, I just got this thing for my college. Sorry, something I should NA do. Well, I'm kind of an on a podcast slash interview kind of thing. Sorry folks.

1 (17m 1s):
Yeah. Are you, are you still feeling I get after a bereavement, especially a close bereavement, such as your mother. I think it can be quite difficult. Do you feel that the moment that life, that you kind of, yeah, life kind of paints a different perspective. Now

2 (17m 25s):
There are times where I still feel the loss of my mother that I don't think that will ever go away for a little bit. Cause it's still kind of depression. I kind of walked away from it just to kind of deal with life again. But now that I'm back in situation again, I don't really want to sit in it. I will remember it, but I won't sit in it again.

1 (18m 3s):
Yeah. Did you have other family that you can go to?

2 (18m 15s):
Yeah.

1 (18m 17s):
Okay. Yeah. I mean, I think losing them up was quite a traumatic time. Yeah. It can take some time to deal with, to be honest with you.

2 (18m 34s):
Yeah. I mean, I basically had to lie to myself on my birthday and say, Hey, it's okay. She's going to call us. She'll say, Hey, I'm alive, still happy birthday. Which eventually I realized that was never going to happen because the day before when my grandma grandmother burst and woke me up is like, Cody, you need to wake up your mother's heart stopped. They've been working on her for 10 minutes. And then I was like, Dylan.

2 (19m 15s):
And I went back and forth. I was like, it's okay. She's alive. No, she is not. They've been working on her for 10 minutes and it's like back and forth. She's alive, she's dead. And then eventually we both had to come to realize you're right. She's dead. Huh. Told you so Dylan, you know?

1 (19m 44s):
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. It's difficult because there's a sense of denial Arctic, I think. Yeah. So Cody, I think you, you always try to meet what's in the first interview that we did. What's shocked me. W w which I blew a shine to you, is that your candor and your intelligence, and you have a sense of B-plus with you.

1 (20m 24s):
I think because of your life so far has been quite a battle and you've gone through different formers. So you have a certain level of beaten us in you and you know, maybe the altars a kind of light in both deep Wells. So maybe when, when you just want to dive a little bit deeper, maybe this Dylan comes up and is like picks the press conference. Well, gentlemen, that's, that's my kind of idea of that's what, that's what struck me when we first spoke.

2 (21m 7s):
Okay, cool. Yeah. I mean, I can totally feel you on that. I mean, each alter does have its own their own sets of emotions and stability and quirks about them, especially Dylan. Well, that's true. I mean, we're our own individual person, you know?

3 (21m 38s):
Yeah.

1 (21m 42s):
What do you lead at the moment in your life? What do you need, Dylan?

2 (21m 51s):
What do I mean by what now?

1 (21m 53s):
What do you need in your life at the moment?

2 (22m 1s):
I guess it's just a stability. Yeah. Stability. I mean, I'm still looking for employment. I'm getting ready to go to college though.

1 (22m 26s):
Have you, do you think that you can explore the artistic side of your personality, maybe express yourself through art or I think, yeah.

2 (22m 41s):
Yeah. I think I can totally do that. I mean, that's what I've mostly done in the hospitals. I've, I've mostly focused on art. I mean, my mother, she, she was an artist herself. That was one Virta things that she would do. And every time I focused on art, I feel somewhat connected to her, you know?

3 (23m 25s):
Yeah.

1 (23m 28s):
Yeah. Give me yourself and express yourself in that way. It's kind of a release. I figure it helps you process emotions. And it's also quite fair Putin, I suppose. I mean, you and I got at the end of it, you get something tangible, get something tangible, kind of deep is anything that you would like to talk about.

2 (24m 19s):
I mean, recently I just gotten to known to know I have a son on a different earth. Who's actually one of my newest altars

1 (24m 39s):
In the multi-verse.

2 (24m 43s):
Right.

1 (24m 47s):
I mean, how does that make you feel? I mean, that's kind of good news, isn't it?

2 (24m 52s):
Yeah, I know. Hmm. That's interesting news actually.

1 (24m 58s):
What is that? A flight is a more advanced or

2 (25m 5s):
I wouldn't say really lost. It's just now and trying to ticket to know him and kind of teach him, you know, I mean, now I have to show him the ropes of being on a completely different earth altogether and that our rules are different from the set of rules they have there.

3 (25m 33s):
Yeah.

1 (25m 45s):
But I suppose that gives you, that gives you something to work on, but you have this child from another, perhaps you can learn from this child, maybe this child has got different abilities.

2 (26m 7s):
Yeah. I would say so. Yeah.

1 (26m 21s):
I kind of think that we can close up here. I still enjoy talking with you and we can still do another episode later on if you want to do that. Cool. Yeah. That's great. Because also my knowledge of dissociative identity disorder is kind of limited when you're welcome. You're welcome to talk about that because at the end of the day, really, this, this show is about you talking about what you want to do when you don't get that choice.

1 (27m 4s):
You don't get that chance in the real world. It's about being able to talk about these things when you don't get a chance in the world world. I think that's important.

2 (27m 21s):
Yeah.

1 (27m 21s):
So Cody, tell me what sort of music do you want me to add to the show?

2 (27m 33s):
I'm kind of feeling techno.

1 (27m 35s):
Okay, cool. So I want to find Dylan for pairing on the show dilemma. Are you still there?

2 (27m 45s):
No problem.

1 (27m 48s):
Curdy. It's always a pleasure. Thank you so much

2 (27m 53s):
For having me here.

1 (27m 54s):
Yeah. We'll keep in touch anyway, on a messaging and I, yeah, definitely, definitely do another episode with you because I think it's always interesting to talk to and, and it's a real pleasure for me to talk to you. Okay. We'll chat later.
