u dive in. brad walden asked give u brief history mental health journey began first symptoms. old you know go medical system. how happened saw doctor know trouble had anything would say journey till today know would be could talk expand on mean persecutory delusions. that. when that. year that. taking i imagine because i think mental health hospitals day quite high security day. okay. yeah. month something it i mitchell. i sure old medication it. w four milligram risperidone top that it. affordable. yeah. kind strange obviously uk paid pound month medication we want. yeah. i know yeah. obviously know i pay thousand pound medication i probably would able afford it eva. know kind of kind a kind ridiculous really. i think yeah true. financial implication going psychosis sure. i think quite talking getting cut paying bill also bad spending habits. i just thing that happened generally good much stable now i tell still big part life. know a big diagnosis big experience well. what feel mental health now. i mean feel now. would make sure relapse know support network important. got girlfriend know about i wondering going slightly different angle. it friend react when went hospital saw medication they relationship change friends. i wondering i think lot normal folk saying everybody get clear headed know lot friend delusions. think separate normal inaudible lesion people who needed see doctor know what is difference. i think i think say said causing harm others get extreme level. medic take pretty seriously. that i mean i think want good position gone hospitals hospital experience taking medication keep stable work employment think i lot people i interview generally statistic say schizophrenia people work. find working benefit you. think helps. you consciously limit foreseeable future putting environments would stressful. feel. feel schizophrenia portrayed medium would see changed. i mean inaudible i delete lost eight years. i delusions harmful me i still i still listen. i go away. just i wake morning something i got deal with always happened i stopped taking medication one year symptom came flooding back i stopped taking medication. i fought i better i fall i stopped taking it i would side effect i would normal. i made mistake. symptom came back really bad i get medication. i just horrible. i ever since i hearing voice time. i think i stopped medication a backfired me. i suspect. yes i mean one reason i podcast is not i want to i want raise awareness for this reasons one thing moment i think useful people cost diagnosis want listen something show i alone. number one. number two normal folk get educated awareness condition rightly say many people grow illness. think dissociative disorder we violent we lax murderers know. question paying cost we normal. people diagnosis. we go we go take medication it. know story. i think know is i think important. i would imagine stopped taking medication i did would probably hard relapse stigma discrimination. i think unfair. i law called the equality act cannot disagree discriminate someone longterm mental health condition hard implement because know they could say oh well grade. he sick days. we get rid them. germane site yeah. yeah. yes does. i know. i going say probably better working home country. yeah. i setting up i worked overseas well dangerous overseas

i think it i finished show much go much trauma go related the mental health condition. know real life trauma happened result young man vulnerable young man system. know much extra stuff deal with. i mean i i hospital back around turn century turn millennium. long time ago year ago. was different back then. bit free open. we smoking room know we boards i think singlesex wards. know wanted charge phone i could charge whenever i wanted to. know different rule back then. i remember people screaming people violent. i w i was know probably around age i w i would ignore go tv room. i mean. kind frightening. frightening age dealing serious psychotic condition people acting disturbing way know say i i recall now looking back i remember people screaming night corridor yeah. sort thing going on. i home treatment team eight year ago. i wonder trap would talk me say he was he saying exactly thing. yes i oh yeah i got life. i thinking know thing it know know dealing psychosis i think also especially young dealing psychosis is challenging. i think take time build insights understanding illness. definitely combat symptom right insight take that. even got that still still difficult. i schizophrenia one hundred schizoaffective schizophrenia. le that. is know is rare. add number population uk example we talking hundred thousand here. are lot folk this we go psychosis. is is know i kind think dealt better know i think i went to i went visit friend in mental health ward year ago high high secure prison. chinese chinese. keeping thing safe locked down. whereas know heavy handed approach i suppose know well know i think mental health staff work wards i think they go little crazy. think so. yeah i think so. yeah. they probably afraid know they probably afraid they understand condition they afraid of of unpredictability it. they sure expect. i suppose they kind shut down yeah i i i genuinely feel everything always case i go to service use always always disorganized they thinking clearly know the staff i think i think they they pick little bit craziness what us yeah. i mean probably reason be something would helped. not know something mathematically kind reassuring. statistic stayed pretty much same. statistic many people become ill schizophrenia schizoaffective pretty constant. look mostly predetermined know obviously light event life trigger it. they trigger maybe earlier trigger all. basically event life. trigger onset. i think i think u we sort trauma other people trauma well. they fine. know i think we just we it. predestined maybe gene something make it make come surface. really. yeah. i mean strange sort of know i statistics i read. i sure i read mathematically quite constant always remains one hundred. something investigate know yeah. artist i grad. so anyways i think we coming time now. i think quite lot say i ask many questions i i have i said guests know are welcome come back second episode know i think good to talk sort thing. obviously got lot say is great. welcome come back another episode. i good. i hope that. i hope start inviting people back episode they continue story. i think say. interesting i really really strike home me that know serious mental condition relationship with difficult family law effects family life expects relationship affect work. hospital affect relationship inside there. whole life dealing symptom top well alone alone got sims top that yeah lot deal with. a bad way we we find stigma we cannot talk normal life. know we talk normal life we kind shut down. and medium portrays people psychosis kind killers. always like yeah guy diagnosed schizophrenia he killed someone know minority. they that. u are know quite peaceful fought for. yeah. thing that know sometimes we blame ourselves. we attack we kind of kind force u back she will. know actually we dealing something quite tough. i think general consensus mental health mental health condition talking best way deal it. we just we got keep talking expressing ourselves know that the healthy way dealing that. oh probably also afraid. know also are early twenties know men be provato strong know. somebody condition make them vulnerable
