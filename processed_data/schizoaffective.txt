easier to avoid them. and and but i i say though thing i know i went probably year law. well good six month whole last year five year i never ever listened voice they still irritated me i knew they there. moment i got caught without earbuds podcast playing without music available i could drown them out. i sitting silence somewhere. a scariest moment me. know i went six month straight i never dealt them all. i w i felt i way recovery know much as one can. i guess last year i would call relapse i gone backwards. and know i weird i gone backwards depression fixed first time life years. yeah. right right. right. well i like i idea though. i concept of know let us know cannot ever prove delusions. kind definition right. they are diluted not thinking correctly. so know i make evidence i i connect thing connected and everyone else says hey tone know are connecting two thing really connected thing really mean think saying. means know occurrence fact a smoking gun. so know i i do i think duncan i get better i think i will time go on i think i one someday find right medication. took me eight year find right depression medication. so know i last five year knows maybe at i find

physically orbital extreme spinning fast cannot see nucleus know question this electronics grain sand. going fast around nucleus cannot even see nucleus far away think they term ratio. know this know in reality like i saying nucleus marble and electron small agreeing sand width hair guess far away they are. two miles. you times . kilometers know. is huge distance. reason i talk metaphor like happens lot. even though mental health system i chemist whenever we able deduce in know sample we put a we drown something known know either helium gas inert gas react anything like alcohol or sort solvent. we molecule look like completely isolates. molecule makeup intended molecule would one ratio. put one unknown substance hundred unknown more. like graph able see out. i trying get two
