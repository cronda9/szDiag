try get try fool them. they looked me funny. mean they caught me changing thoughts. i think well i know schizophrenia a physiological condition due high level dopamine brain. dopamine much it actually erodes. brain matter. actually shrink brain. every time psychotic episode even my thought schizophrenia definitely physiological condition. see mri scans. see the shrunk frontal lobe tiny get wrinkled deformed become constant exposure dopamine. understanding diagnose mri scan easily see brain destruction someone skull. long term along amount long long time constant delusion hallucinations actually see decay. people schizophrenia also high risk alzheimers dementia lose brain matter brain age is know destructive. patient hat. okay. actually i know i looked it. i look thing medically mechanically. brain function patient. i see taking medicine best defense repetitive psych psychosis. i keep taking meds i going stay nice sane i going lose brain matter. i going stay young functioning i patient. i see. i kind wish they blood test schizophrenia. i sure they would check me i jen the marker would something that. looking take blood test. i mris. they they they scanned head they saw shrinkage frontal lobe. they like yeah definitely sort function functionary issue brain. okay. okay. yeah. i i seek rationalize happens brain already medical. i was i like oh yeah totally happening me be could number things. they really cause schizophrenia. they really sure yet. like i i i read many paper different viewpoint a people think traumabased others think chemical base dopamine action. people think glutamate completely completely different neuro transmitter brain. newer drug aimed treat glutamate path pathway opposed dopamine pathway. depends person. could number reason schizophrenia exists. different every individual it. ok i photographer. i working nurse i i use camera get extra cash. i also create art i shoot wedding events stuff that. main focus portraits. i try express feeling

diagnosed around saw relatively late diagnosed i symptom then. i went stressful period me girl i seeing longterm ended breaking i kind distraught that. stress sorta provoked first psychosis. psychosis lasted six month i went to i was i exhibiting paranoia much hallucinations paranoia just i thinking correctly for i forgot name symptom is yeah delusion i know they pretty much textbook delusions know persecutory delusions. is list. think persecuted something else could be could be know think governments you think people putting know stuff house watch you persecutory delusion anything feel persecuted other. i exhibiting those i know i thought people putting thing house watch me. reason. i i thought government me later i thought witch real. they became bizarre. bizarre non bizarre. thinking governments you even though probably not non bizarre not know supernatural or anything that. mine non bizarre thing could improve could disprove highly unusual unlikely unusual. so yeah i ended emergency room they they ask two question every time. thinking hurting yourself. no. thinking hurting people. like i really making much sense. i they asking me i knew i needed help. i kind of i forgot name is are kind touch reality. i said yes one ended me a really high i think i court order me to they take me. i was i taken mental hospital police car shackles great mental health. and know never dangerous anybody anything i just yeah is ended happening. i taking tennessee north tennessee central tennessee hour half car ride. i want say   . yeah. especially tell them might hurt someone else they put your giant hotel almost. probably story i top it. least likely able get way. reason they put happened. ended happening. i later i went a i was i went live family georgia delusion passed. well they they going pas time. first psychosis. i went much better mental health hospital in georgia. so yeah that much better. slowly my six months delusion went away i ended going back work kentucky. i went fmla family medical leave act six months they save job they use leave have. but know i was i almost extending past allowable amount would six months. the medicine they ended putting me inaudible risks. they injectable shot risperidone. get month. they ended putting me something else working another injectable. i actually i went it. i forgot name that. a vegas stand palpate own. i

me that. so know i was they saw me dark times know extended social group coworkers i had they just they much except one. they saw me kind go away six month come back. and know i kind come back. i doctors note i needed money financially to survive. know my mom she life social security government sort assistance working and know brother they make good money they spend it. so know trying get disability. i luckily my mind kind cleared know i go onto disability longterm life shambles bill collectors calling medical. know especially get world politics mom she diagnosed depression she is she is know she delusional come certain her political theory she thinks know conspiracy type theories. i think sort link that they go know consume them much delusion would me would consume me. delusion just i could think anything else delusion time. whereas mom know she perfectly normal subjects know bring politics her she is know she belief certain thing possible. know they outlandish i i think people that she she might best she related me. my mental health come somewhere it pr i know i seen people too they just come politics they their idea might be know possible. yeah. i mean me psychosis totally different me being know everyday. is also big dichotomy between know two different type people be. i think like know constantly think people get something consuming you might conspiracy theorist. it like logical one area like suddenly think that know witch there then i think would different. know i think would likely cause concern know. that me. i mean i know. i think i think know i always me i think come to finances. know cannot afford medication afford know good food or know healthy lifestyle stressfree lifestyle know money help get money from unfortunately states know disability get maybe know  month enough really survive areas. i think money brings more le stress which le stress know allows an psychosis much least circumstance. was continual thing was know i know girlfriend break me go psychosis know i move halfway across world go psychosis. stress big factor me going psychosis also taking medicine. that know i moved since know i go psychosis then i taking medicine point. no really. know i feel i almost anything someone else would do. i just know i i i think medicine help ton. i think i medicine this i moved year ago i think that know car broke my haul burke down i hit big pothole i totaled youhaul. breakdown like i stranded side road eight hours. stressful event i still go psychosis. i thinking is know well lot people understand it. so know they get it they get split personality disorder. lot people think might i people they i not i like i still see portrayed. i even true mine psychosis hit me i completely different person dangerous. i still understand certain norm and thing that. is know like i know like like i ask question. like yours affect time. like it come episode leave episodes. yeah. i much dangerous i would ever anybody else even going through know psychosis yeah i not i think lot people understand is i is know mind go dark place i psychosis i know like want stop know whatevers going on. is make sense. probably. that thing

crux high. pain. yeah bad. i put on i put two stone two month i just i slept i slept much i i found hard get anything make hard kids. i got year old. i got twelveyearold i got seven year old. well i have i live different country i i first got sick. the friend i good. yeah. i have i able pretty open them. i lost lot friend i first i first got yeah lost lot friends. definitely. well partly factor i would i would to i would get job i would work kid bit older school stuff i sure i would do. been long. i without job i sure i would go back to. yeah. would really cool. i think i would really that. i got i good day bad days know med helped lot but they not they help entirely. i still i still delusion stuff. sometimes i catch out. i quite good catching out. negative symptoms i think mostly affect me point. i just i find thinking i read mind i take step back like head. know need communicate people assume thing because sometimes lately. past week two but yeah sometimes sometimes i just i assume i they thinking. yeah. find acting necessarily based really going on. i my my voice lot time people. i they sound sound people. i know. i found confusing. i honestly know. something wrong head. yeah. hard sometimes find draw line too. it inner inner thought starting become problem. i mean. i exactly mean oh i try take really easy. i spend i i spend lot time distracting myself try stick basic schedule i kid obviously not much we lockdown. okay. i used i would again i supply moment. i think something i going coming weeks. i brought paper sketchbook run paints. i think is hard not like i guess lot people like oh god horrible thing could ever happen. life know. yeah. we just we regular people. i knock home. gone. inaudible phone. nothing. we cannot pretend. keep acting silly. task inaudible inaudiblewell actually i diagnosed  i first started experiencing symptoms paranoid symptom . actually i ended quitting job. i worked bank point i started getting idea people i worked saying horrible thing me talking behind back and led me quit bank i really understand going much later i ended up i guess probably common thing schizophrenia i ended becoming getting drug kind deal it is made everything worse obviously. know they kind fed i diagnosed actually i legal trouble court asked i kind a mental health examination. i diagnosed. yeah. definitely they they asked me ton question i know actually probably first time i ever totally honest doctor well. i think that might be know something may experience also kind hiding know your symptom people because know i mean okay well i diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia paranoia big part i experienced experience. i guess i also auditory they called auditory hallucinations. i since come understand differently year experience i also seen thing kind everything i also i not i exactly explain experienced coincidence i would see two thing connected normally would be i would see time  yes. synchronicity. exactly. big thing me well. is. i think long time i tried believe just know my malfunctioning brain creating this actually synchronicity part made impossible me believe that. i have since i started seeking spiritual journey and i think that i now. well i mean i spent lot time pretty much entirety twenty part alone. i understand going on. actually past three four year i really started understand i experiencing i able move forward start building life healthy way. mmm. well i guess long time i i believed i experiencing coming disease mind coming elsewhere. unfortunately well reason i say way kind i always told western medicine. know working properly need medication work properly kind thing. and i really i tried board i could not i could year i experienced i itheres way i could allow believe me working properly. i started seeking answer elsewhere. i started developing spirituality understanding it. know healer i level two reiki i also thing well. i coming understand universe works everything energy much than we really talk point human evolution. i think i come understand universe better helped me find reason i experiencing coming from. helped me deal stuff i experiencing find healthy way dealing thing necessarily medications. mmm tricky question i right now i currently medication part. day fairly positive. i bad day there i learned i learned really psychosis i think i am know western medical standpoint yeah. i probably experience psychosis new found perspective i i see able communicate spirit guide angel uhhuh yes i also believe that. yeah. yeah. i think i think like saying schizophrenia sensitive universe versus people may fully aware everything going around them. well i colorado originally. actually four year ago i moved new york myself. point time i still using drug i still much confused everything going around me actually new york allowed me opportunity seek answers. i think i lived colorado lot family is i seeking answer answer they wanted me seek out. know they they ones like oh got talk therapist got take medication got stuff. kind stopped me seeking answers. actually moving completely thousand mile away anyone i really knew allowed me start seeking answers. actually probably helpful thing me. i definitely have. office i used go lot them much anymore i also i think i connected group recovering addict i found group called smart recovery. yeah. definitely created suffering i ever experienced. i think they kind feed i experiencing thing schizophrenia sick really knowing deal finding i guess level comfort drugs ultimately also fueling thing making thing worse negative. been pretty crazy. i think though i entered recovery addiction problems i learned recovery really helped me understand situation understand i am. also lead development spiritual self i relate rest universe. i think ultimately worth it i guess. so yeah. definitely actually website i working blog post drug right spirituality how i come see certain drug marijuana ahyuhasca payoti they tendency raise vibration connect higher spiritual realms whereas drug heroin methamphetamine well actually lower vibration significantly connect much lower spiritual realm negative energy thrive exists demonic energy will want call that. actually something i come understand schizophrenic drug addict recovery both. i sorry. i think we technical difficulties. i caught beeped out. i caught last said. yeah definitely. i i longer see schizophrenia curse something detrimental health. i learned least far experience go i learned deal use advantage. i i am i much grateful something i experienced help me better healer. help me help people. really i dedicating life helping others. yeah. i think experience have shown me i help people. i guess. i i feel everything i gone kind almost training program sort i understand unit way i understand now. and know yeah. yeah. i feel like know i gone now. i everything i know. i knowledge i going well. we connected know. definitely part it. i think i visited new york twice i moved kind fell love thing really going well well me colorado. i think i moved bunch different reasons ultimately i think i supposed be. city definitely speed. i definitely go person city nothing going. i think i fit plus is always something around corner weird interesting. i think affords me opportunity meet experience people world. i mean know many different culture clash here many different people different beliefs. is wonderful actually. yeah. i think family they they understand mental health part it. thing worst thing crazy negative they understand i around them. i kind removed family experience friends. i said before i think i spent pretty much year kind myself trying understand this. great though past what two three years i gotten better come understand thing different way i able reconnect family. almost everythings normal again. pretty cool. oh i lost almost frank oh we go. would well i say i am know i think pop culture funny way of using mental health specifically schizophrenia thing kind way of know explaining violent horrible people in pop culture know movie thing that. honestly i yet meet schizophrenia person violent trying destroy things i think schizophrenia least one i encountered life people good people want hurt anyone else really experiencing thing intense confusing they want answers. they want relief symptoms. i know. i i need take them anymore. i able wean them. yeah. i have i probably typical atypical antipsychotics one point another past years trying different things seeing thing work they not. really none them ever really improved situation. my development spirituality. improved situation helped me. yeah i think time the the the benefit outweigh the negative side effect them. i took one drug made me feel big body. i felt i going explode constantly. i going explode body. i know. they make me tired game wait. yeah. i mean i cases medication helpful people. i think specific personal experience development spirituality really changed everything me. is. i think i mean far far i understand it i think we kind moving a phase human evolution i think going become much prevalent. i think we are we going start understand spirituality place universe year come. yeah i mean i think really schizophrenia rooted spirituality connection rest universe. i think we understand universe surround us we understand we fit that they help u understand symptom auditory visual hallucination different things synchronicity we notice. i think explained. understanding universe better. i guess i come understand auditory hallucination really telepathic communication conscious entity there. spirit guides. i think that know i array experience far go harassed put overwhelmingly medic negative experience communication tell me know oh you say going rain today might want bring umbrella case turn rain know they positive. they negative. i have know understood coming from i understood difference them. i able take away negative experience allow keep experiencing positive ones. yeah. i paranoid delusion intense. yeah. they caused great deal damage past many things i got it. oh okay. i said i i come understand thing originated from. i able learn block experience protect sort thing universe full positive negative energy. i think know learning certain thing come certain places protect thing and make experience positive. i we almost time. corona virus. right now they trying get control pretty much. they want u wear mask stuff. well i first became male i lived in apartment complex town i started hear things.

disbursable still gave partial effect. i think lead deterioration. i started develop lot delusions. i thinking people given line they me. big test. i thing kicking door stalker i thought i one guy asked me retrieve him property him there. i thought i need that. task me. i lot of sort things i go fights. lot fight going on. i think big sort criticism bit prison eat prison food lot fight going

available take minutes half hour simple things go room. really sort of it make patient patient get buy the obviously aggravates lot patients. they would waiting minute get really angry rode they shouting screaming fight. everyone yeah i think design would lead issues. yeah. initially psychosis i second episode change schizophrenia. moment i still hear it. i still delusions. i going go walk i got dog i walking dog. i think people attack me it stem real life issue i had. i stopped. i been i money head i have i gone lot traumatic experience genuine police came house warm me family it. delusion i lot real life stress i think contributes well. tipping point psychosis source psychosis manifest around that. delusion people going attack me i working people attack me nowhere. exactly. i also delusion grandeur thinking i going able redact. i going join secret illuminati group telepathic. that would allow me sort run world way ad tv sort way me journey join them part facet organization. i really there i have i recovered help medication. i power paradigm injection is know depot they call him month really help sort deal symptom delusions side effects. hand getting sort shakey arm get contorted awkward. it give a terrible sort brain fog way. think really think clearly preferable ideal preferable schizophrenia badly i guess. okay. right. friends i put crazy stuff instagram story i hospital. i talking devil holocaust camp. lot people sort acquaintance they distanced me close friend sort just they they they have thereve along journey. well i think awhile i got hospital i trying get job i put cv i psychosis i get interview i took cv. i think lot discrimination people psychosis schizophrenia they want employ them i see risk. soon i took cv i got job working warehouse that going nowhere. i think lot sort societal discrimination against know especially working world like yeah especially working world okay. eventually i would start business. i sort involved smooth start bitcoin trading really successful. i made lot money that. sort given me taste like know i really love it. i think one day i want start business business degree well hard. i think i notice challenge i working warehouse. i got called crazy couple people. sometimes i working hall big sort building i walking around outside sort feel impending doom sensation get really worried impact me much. i able go job definitely part working schizophrenia. sort teal the the symptom work in extra challenge definitely overcomeable put mind it. one hallucination life sort of i looking floor i saw spider come floor walk around sort sunk back floor i heard one. hopefully get worse regarding that delusions i mean i think so especially i hospital i delusion i used sort thing everyone every patient completely sane they test me challenged me. i would try sort take take piss them go along test thought gave me task complete get hospital. really really leave me whole time i hospital. i think know left me i hospital i started sort ass reality bit like okay. nothing happened happen joined secret illuminati. maybe true. case. quite bad image. sort image people are violin they want attack people crazy stay away them. i think we normal people got issue it. i think i know i think represented medium well. apart from tv show a one maniac is represented really well. i think scene he go someone whose voice said going leader something save world. they go along delusion its sort brought back reality. i thought i really related scene sort exemplifies going delusion coming back reality. show shutter island sort seen that. i feel well yeah i think good film. interesting film really represent schizophrenia sort show violent money. people want blow car stuff cannot reasonably. i use it. good film i not. i think represent sort schizophrenia violent lot sort of violence go on. he attacking people ah he close car sort split point guy like car i really angry that quite well. i would relate much. i think i even touch that medium portrayal schizophrenia negative very negative. hear bad incident one time police talking him it. sort going guy road killed family got arrested murder put asylum. like hear bad side i think time important realize sort dark side psychosis. go wrong cannot completely disruptive someone living schizophrenia dealing collusion stuff someone complete mania psychosis. i think important recognize difference that. i mean i think term coping strategies reading really useful. i gotten book far. i hearing voice if i felt lot control internal monologue reading book help sort get control back it. i sort be help bring peace really good coping strategy. i think listening music well i spend lot page relaxing listening music. i think great coping strategy. sort relaxing allowing sort bit sanity come back equation. okay. i think main thing if friend someone going schizophrenia moment try best support them way can. is hard losing friend go schizophrenia support them better cutting them off. you care them best even they seem delusional go along delusion talk them try connect them emotional level talk something saying they enjoy maybe tv show something still still human. i think important recognize. song mind playing trick me. i think great thing caught eye. i play royalty free music i probably pay make stop crying. anyway fantastic speak you. great pleasure. know your candid candid. i think i sense break down man. know want want say want honest possible know talk experience know practice speak know close. yeah. great speaking you. great. righthi thank me. i fine. i glad part show. i really idea. well actually i think i inherited condition mother. she diagnosed her twenty i actually told i acted know weird way even baby know i would would laugh cry. i would stare one spot. i also exhibited strange behavior growing a elementary school high school. and i think symptom skyrocketed late teen i year old i never taught i schizophrenia. i i thought i was i normal i living normal life. i never wanted mother. i thought i was i bad. i actually signed uni. i enrolled uni i got kicked strange behavior. i made incident i got kicked out later i started another union. i actually managed finish somehow. i unemployed years i finally managed find job i also kicked also i exhibited strange behavior i kind harassed colleague. i got fired led first suicide attempt. i admitted hospital i went psychiatrist i diagnosed . well i put it. i pretty fine. i i accepted it. i accepted destiny i trying to live normal life much i can even though not not i greatly moment know strange idea forth. hard to to go psychiatrist corona situation. yes. well yeah i everyone else i lease delusion stuff that. yearly earliest one i remember that i a kind computer brain calculation telling me stuff it i know. i thought i was i thought everybody love me everybody hated me stuff that. basics. yeah definitely. i mean the the get older you somehow learn recognize snap it. know i younger i i i would delusion last year last hour two i i managed snap somehow i i going get trouble thinking eventually. kind learn snip it. i guess get older wiser experience it. well feel anything abnormal know felt i thought everybody it. i thought everybody else taught that everybody else computer brain something that. normal part. part my personality. i thought i even thought i was i smarter everyone else. stuff hurt me way i totally obsessed it. like i never told her illness something that well really short treatment. i treated mental illness. i treated i i overdosed medicine. i given i v stuff that. i treated schizophrenia. i given call it. paper to go psychiatrist that. i went psychiatrist i knew something wrong me. i just i sit sat and i reexamined life. i realized something wrong. i went psychiatrist it. pretty bad. i think she really interested hearing problem finding solution. they mostly work based on based template. like oh okay. here try medicine next. know i a one hundred people. took her time really listen and helped me. yeah definitely. i agree. i hold grunge grudge them. like they lot work. they overworked underpaid. they know they hundred patients. free healthcare. like going get best best. want best probably pay it. i i mean. i went mother she a she severe side effect her medicine they care. they said well why. i actually read side effect medicine. like lead death. i personally started looking another solution. maybe another psychiatrist maybe different medicine maybe reducing dosage stuff that. accept free health care going get best best service. find solution sometimes. yeah. well probably know the western society definitely advanced especially compared europe eastern europe. first all a country personally mental health great taboo. mentally ill seen alien a i know monster something that. not schizophrenia generally. schizophrenia most i infamous disease ever country. they call cancer soul. imagine people think about. and know first all great difference treatment. first thing that that kind america europe detection stillness diagnosis. there mechanism detection a schools in know hospitals police department on. hard to to determine mentally ill schizophrenia. example if student acting strangely school highly likely may maybe he schizophrenia nobody going help him way. a personal experience. so know i always treated clown weirdo alien something that. first all mechanism detection. problem in advanced societies progressive society ones know second thing actually the treatment treatment much better western world. i think the there medicine better. lot different medicines psychiatrist. lot of lot support know society employment programs. none bosnia disability disability both. i mean is really hard get a negligible. get like i know  month a hundred dollar month is nothing. thing help society least the the support family friends people close you. th little bit difference boston friend family likely support you. everything else disaster i think globally going change i think going to going get better there new treatment option people talking it. many scientific researcher on. help. yeah well honest maybe i am maybe i little bit exaggerating well realize that know society boston society pretty conservative. know is little bit we could even call backwards. person these strange views strange ideas they better accepted in example america know pretty progressive society. little bit america what excuse me. yeah i guess european society generally similar around compare america canada. little bit progressive. well i actually want talk future. well right like i this. i wish. say actually i want to plan future i want apartment able hold job. i working it i actually i being i whole hell cognitive problems. i actually wanted to emphasize the problem of of of know cognitive problem phrenia they tend get worse you get older. i struggling now. and know i just i confused forgetful i i find hard focus stuff that. so able help hold job pretty much impossible know. i think research is. schizophrenia going to going go direction help many people struggling disease pr problem is medicine tell it know medicine help positive simpson symptoms hallucination stuff that. i actually wanted emphasize. w i help me i exercise i eat healthy. i think advice everyone else struggling disease imperative exercise eat healthy. really help symptoms even side effect schizophrenia. sometime still get get anxious depressed stuff that. really help exercising. i think it a main reason we ostracized society society one dimensional know a thing respect average joe know guy good average job two kids wife housing suburb everything different way abnormality. i think we we persons schizophrenia. i think we some unusual gifts. i think guy first guy me interview frank talked little bit we maybe gift communicate spiritual world something that. lot talk it. lot people talked terence mckenna alan watts on. i think we embrace our know extent tricity fact two are we different. we different way thinking i think society also accept u different people. know i think we some some kind maybe could help people way. definitely i think whenever i i embraced weirdness centricity i happy. i would say i even better accepted people. whenever i tried average joe i failed miserably. i think society really focused much treating schizophrenia making u turning u average. joes maybe little bit know i think also learn accept us i think we unique way. yeah definitely. i think we some sort unique brains know is we understand reality we observe reality a different perspective. i think people actually learn appreciate it. sometimes we hundred percent lunatic something. i give specific song music genre. well yeah can electronic music house kind house end. yeah. something happy dance to something that. thank me. i really liked show giving chance express inaudible inaudible inaudible inaudibleyou know is is a year. i i work one hospital chaotic is it i i fortunate hospital really great they handling thing going on. been stressful time lot people. i think kind exacerbate lot peoples awareness health general. necessarily covid everyone kind like okay well this this that is know everyone kind high strong okay. yeah. is been lot people taking seriously. is lot people area taking seriously they probably been. i i think kind ubiquitous throughout world. well world just unfortunate people take seriously tend spread people not is certain thing unavoidable lot thing i think we could country done better getting completely two rail that. interesting. schizophrenia sense it seems thing happening he part grand delusion something i know almost kind pretend like oh yeah no actually happen. crap. mind made living. yeah. i guess it probably started i symptoms. i started probably i younger kid. i remember like looking air seeing thing hand air something knee feeling i something something bad care happened stand circle here otherwise know house going collapse. cannot prevent house collapsing unless stand imaginary circle drawn yourself. i remember one time staring toy had seeing dance. i think point i kind sleep deprived. i never really able sleep well night throughout high school i think kind got construed depression. i really sad. i withdrawn. i really like i guess negative symptom wise really motivation do. anything felt distant people try kind lash me environment way kind productive a kind i kind thing. got diagnosed depression put prozac. i think i tried thing really agree me. better antidepressant probably big red flag depression begin with. i kind major psychotic break college. roommate kind found me huddle up kind mumbling myself. i

originally wanted me two milligrams i know we we worked one. i figured less le i take know the necessarily better le side effect i kind deal with. many side effect just get me little bit lethargic one milligram seems fine. i psychotic breaks. they tolerable. they is i handle the amount med i on make any i mean that also kind weird beliefs. everyone way i best describe feel brain going calm compartmentalized. just different sections. kind thing they not they quock cross wire exactly right. they should. i i tend mumble talk like i think everyone degree unaware they regard something else. sometimes i tend forget i at split second. i weird twitch. i twitch every again. i cannot tell medication urge disease something completely different i get know native symptoms. occasionally i get positive symptoms. i i necessarily see things i definitely hear things. usually people outside wall talking they coming arrest me get me i hear lot piano music outside room kind quiet feeling i need

bos or know somebody say livelihood akin somebody saying oh person diabetes. what know. yeah exactly. just is is weird thing to i lot people it. i think more issue. is portrayal media. see see people their padlock room something. there are people have condition much worse i have. i feel i functioning everything considered necessarily mean that know vast majority need round clock care take away fact they either. just part life. dealing shit. i think are yeah. is is like i regard i have. i i control i accept that is also just i i i say person reacts something they willing put time listening side things. i cannot i cannot force people. idea we life we gone things. if age exact access information i have. still choose believe certain things. even hearing side it then know good luck living life that. rda is not i the i said only way affect me voting issue would lessen certain burden create more depending sway outcome whatever yes no. it i said very necessarily job hard stressful. just i work lot people lot stress pressure they i anybody worked healthcare lot people bit attitude sometimes. yeah. is fine. i get it. i get it. but know i work a area you basically either either tell somebody really good news constantly tell people bad news. is fun way to i guess i say fun vexing difficult conversation day clinical what. cynical. cynical. oh yeah. sorry. no i i work. i just i process specimens. usually i make call we cannot run test. is. is is feel finally starting wind down big relief but know let u say always going good bad days my work very nice able get house. also is
